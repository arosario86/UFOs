# UFOs
## Overview
Dana has asked for my help creating a web page that can filter data on all UFO sightings in the US. She presented a large data file with each sighting.
## Results
After the webpage was created and we added filters to the page, a user will be able to filter the data based on date, city, state, country, and shape of UFO. This will allow the table to filter the results based on what the person is looking for.
The new page design is now dark, to match the night sky.

The new filters are aligned at the bottom of the table, making it easy for one to search exactly what they are looking for.

## Summary
Although the webpage looks great visually, I feel that a button should be added back to the design. We have added more filter options, but I feel that this new design is not intuitive enough. One may feel that their filters are not processing without a filter button. I also feel that there should be more date for surrounding countries. US data is good to start, but a user may be interested in the number of sightings in Canada, for example, or even Mexico.
